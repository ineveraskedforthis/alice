# Factory Refit

Player can refit factories from one type into another from Factories list in Production window (arrow up button).

Refit goods cost = (TO type construction cost) - (FROM type construction cost) + (0.1f * TO type construction cost)

Conditions to refit factory from one type into another:
  - The nation is civilized
  - This si not a colonial state
  - The technology requirements to construct the factory are met (factory always available or a tech unlocking the building is researched)
  - The factory is not already being upgraded
  - OR:
	- Ruling party allows building factories
	- Old and new types have the same inputs or the same outputs

The last conditions means that in truly democratic and capitalist economies the government represented by the state cannot break the private property laws and make capitalists change the production line of their factory.
